# Research Project
Creating a video conferencing application using Flask in Python, and WebRTC in Javascript.

The Flask is our Signaling Server, which manages sockets thanks to Flask_SocketIO, and handles offers/answers from clients. The Javascript handles the creation of the video and audio streams through WebRTC.
